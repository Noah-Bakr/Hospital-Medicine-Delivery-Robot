## Project Overview

During COVID-19, hospital staff were stretched thin. This robot was designed to:
- Deliver medicine and equipment across hospital wards
- Reduce the burden of minor tasks on nurses
- Navigate autonomously using colour-based line detection
- Avoid obstacles with ultrasonic sensors

---

## System Components

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Arduino Uno** | Core microcontroller |
| **TCS230 Color Sensor** | Detects coloured lines for navigation |
| **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** | Obstacle avoidance |
| **L298N Motor Driver** | Controls dual DC motors |
| **DC Motors with Wheels** | Movement |
| **RGB LED & Buzzer** | User feedback and status |
| **Force Sensor** | Detects object placement |

---

## Program Flow

1. Detect button press (room selection)
2. Read line colour with TCS230 sensor
3. Follow coloured line using motor logic
4. Slow/stop when obstacles are detected
5. Beep and light feedback on departure/arrival

## Testing & Evaluation

The robot was evaluated for:
- **Line following** accuracy
- **Obstacle detection** responsiveness
- **Transport capability** (limited prototype stage)
- **Looping behavior** (issues with loop lock fixed via code suggestions)

Improvements discussed include:
- Nested loops for proper logic transitions
- Additional sensors for destination detection
- NFC or colour-coded stop zones
- Improved object holder design

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of modular code for debugging
- Arduino loop management using nested control structures
- Balancing hardware limitations with creative solutions
- Real-world applicability and constraints in healthcare tech
